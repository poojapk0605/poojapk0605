# 👋 Hi, I'm Pooja Kannan

🚀 DevOps | Cloud | MLOps | Kubernetes | Terraform | AWS | GCP  
🎓 MS in Cyber-Physical Systems @ Northeastern | Passionate about scalable infra & automation

I specialize in designing automated pipelines and reliable systems using Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions. My current work involves end-to-end MLOps deployment using Vertex AI, Apache Airflow, and Google Cloud Storage on GKE for chatbot automation and vector search.
