# 👋 Hi, I'm Pooja Kannan

🎓 Master’s student in Cyber-Physical Systems at Northeastern University (Graduating May 2025)  
🚀 DevOps | MLOps | Cloud Engineer in Progress · Member of the MLOps Community

I specialize in building scalable, reliable cloud-native infrastructure using tools like **Terraform**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **Jenkins**, and **GitHub Actions**. I'm currently developing an end-to-end MLOps pipeline with **Vertex AI**, **Airflow**, and **GCS** on **GKE** for chatbot automation.
